# Workopia

Workopia is a job listing website that is taken from a Udemy course PHP 2024 with part of the course being project based. This app is the project and one of the interesting aspects is it creating a framework that while similar to Laravel or Symphony, it is much simplier and doesn't have nearly the bells and whistles that those do. 

Will update this file as I progress through the course.
